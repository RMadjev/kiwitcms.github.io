After our [recent success]({filename}2020-09-01-eu-web-awards-finalist.markdown)
we again ask the community to support Kiwi TCMS.


*Steps to reproduce:*

1. Go to <https://stars.github.com/>
2. Click the **Sign in** button and Authorize the GitHub-Stars application
3. Make sure you are on the **Nominate page**, <https://stars.github.com/nominate/>
4. Type `kiwitcms` as the username. The `@` character is provided automatically
5. Type the following text for your reasoning:
   `they took an abandoned project and turned it into the leading open source
    test management system with more than 150k downloads with users & contributors
    across the world!`
6. Click on the checkbox to acknowledge your nomination
7. Click the **Submit nomination** button!


*Expected results:*

1. You fit into the 180 characters provided for nomination
2. Your submission is recorded by GitHub


Why are we doing this
---------------------

GitHub Stars is a program that recognizes those who go above and beyond and help
inspire and educate their communities which is exactly what the
[Kiwi TCMS team]({filename}pages/team.html) has been doing from our very start!
Checkout our [community blog posts](/blog/tags/community/) for more information!


This program will give us access to cool new features
on the GitHub platform and also let us showcase what we do before a larger audience!


Thank you for helping us and happy testing!
